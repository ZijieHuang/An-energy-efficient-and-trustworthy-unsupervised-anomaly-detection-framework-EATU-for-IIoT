This repository is my PhD first year work.

The abstract of my work is as followed:

e propose a new two-levelautomatic feature extraction based unsupervised anomaly detec-tion method for IIoT. It possesses two levels of feature extraction:1) Autoencoder-based feature extraction and 2) SHAP-basedexplainable feature selection. We show that repeatedly doingfeature extraction by autoencoder can get a higher accuracyfor anomaly detection, and with the important features selectedby SHAP explainer, the rationale of why an anomaly detectiondecision was made is given, enhancing the trustworthiness of thedetection as well as further improving the accuracy of anomalydetection. Three real world IIoT datasets comprising with high-dimensional features are used to validate the effectiveness ofthe proposed unsupervised anomaly detection model. Extensiveexperiments show that our approach can get a higher accuracyfor anomaly detection and enhance the trustworthiness of thedetection.
